    Oud, or agarwood, is an aromatic resinous wood that comes from the Aquilaria tree. 
    Native to South East Asia, particularly Cambodia, India, Thailand, and Indonesia, 
    the tree produces a dark, fragrant resin as a natural defence mechanism against mould, 
    resulting in the formation of oud. Considered one of the most highly prized natural 
    materials in the world, oud is often referred to as "liquid gold" due to its rarity and 
    global appeal.

        Oud is widely used as a base in high-end perfumes because of its rich, deep and complex aroma 
        that blends warm, woody and slightly sweet notes. It can add depth and sophistication to 
        existing fragrance products.
